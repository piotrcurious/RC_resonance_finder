example prompts used to generate code :
create Arduino code trying to find value of resistor used in RC circuit connected to digital output pin with internal resistance defined by max current of 20mA. Use strategy of iterating sending various lenght pulses to RC circuit and measure change of resistance of RC circuit by using kirhoff law to find pulse length corresponding to frequency providing maximum analog voltage reading . Assume known capacitance of 10uF. Assume Arduino can read voltage across capacitor by using A0 analog input pin . The resistance finding code should work as a function and be called each 60 seconds to check if resistance did change . Include explainations of equations in comments. Remember last resonant frequency and use it to perform binary search seed for next attempt. Use Kalman filter to stabilize measurement. Construct Kalman filter so it adjusts it's model to detect convergence of frequency of the system to the resonant frequency.
